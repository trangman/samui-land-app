Sure, here are the steps to create a new repository on GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
    - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
    - Click on the '+' icon at the top right corner of the page, then select 'New repository'.
    - Name your repository (for example, "real-estate-app").
    - Choose whether you want your repository to be public (visible to everyone) or private (only visible to you and people you invite).
    - You can initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license if you want, but this is not necessary.
    - Click 'Create repository'.

2. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    - On the main page of the repository, click the 'Code' button.
    - Copy the URL that appears.
    - Open a terminal on your local machine.
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    - Type `git clone [URL]`, replacing `[URL]` with the URL you copied. Press Enter.

3. **Add your Django project to the repository:**
    - Move your Django project files into the cloned repository directory on your local machine.
    - In the terminal, navigate to the repository directory.
    - Type `git add .` to stage all the files for commit. Press Enter.
    - Type `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to commit the files. Press Enter.

4. **Push the commit to GitHub:**
    - Type `git push origin main` to push the commit to the main branch on GitHub. Press Enter.

Your Django project is now on GitHub. You can continue to make changes on your local machine, commit them, and push them to GitHub as you work on your project.
